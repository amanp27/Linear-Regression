ðŸ“š Case Study: Predicting Salaries Based on CGPA ðŸŽ“ðŸ’¼

In this case study, we aim to predict salaries (in LPA) of students based on their CGPA using Simple Linear Regression. This project demonstrates how academic performance influences salary offers.

Objective:

To build a predictive model that provides insights into salary trends based on CGPA and evaluates its accuracy using key metrics.

Model Evaluation:

Evaluated the model using the following metrics:

* Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.56 LPA (average error in predictions).
* Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 0.61 LPA (emphasizes larger errors).
* RÂ² Score: 0.96 (indicates that 96% of salary variation is explained by CGPA).

Key Observations

* The model performed well, with a high RÂ² score, showing a strong correlation between CGPA and salary.
* A slight gap between MAE and RMSE indicates that a few predictions had larger errors.
