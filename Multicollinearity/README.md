# Multicollinearity in Regression Analysis üö¶

* Multicollinearity is a fascinating yet tricky challenge in regression analysis. It occurs when independent variables are highly correlated, making it difficult to isolate their individual contributions to the target variable.
*  I explore Multicollinearity using the Boston Housing Dataset, detect its presence, and tackle it with best practices. üè†üìä

## üåü What is Multicollinearity?

Multicollinearity happens when independent variables are interdependent, creating:

* Unstable Coefficients: Small data changes lead to big coefficient changes.
* Interpretability Problems: Hard to explain each variable‚Äôs unique impact.
* Inflated Standard Errors: Confidence in the estimates decreases.

## üîç How Do We Detect Multicollinearity?
### 1. Correlation Matrix
* Visualize the relationships between variables. High absolute values (close to +1 or -1) suggest multicollinearity.
### Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)
* Measures how much a variable's variance increases due to multicollinearity.
* Rule of Thumb: VIF > 5 (or sometimes >10) signals high multicollinearity.

## üõ†Ô∏è Fixing Multicollinearity
### Drop Variables
* If two variables convey similar information, drop one to reduce redundancy.
* Example: Removing TAX when RAD already explains the target well.

### Feature Engineering
* Combine correlated variables into one (e.g., average or ratio).

### Regularization Techniques
* Use Ridge Regression or Lasso Regression to reduce multicollinearity's impact by penalizing large coefficients.

## üìà Key Takeaways
* Multicollinearity distorts regression results.
* VIF and correlation matrices are your best friends for detection.
* Solving multicollinearity ensures accurate, interpretable models.
* Multicollinearity inflates standard errors, making coefficient estimates unreliable.
* Techniques like dropping features, combining features, and using regularization can mitigate its effects.
* The Boston Housing dataset is a practical example for studying and resolving multicollinearity in real-world datasets.

## Other Techniques
* Combine Features
* Use Regularization Techniques

## Document Your Observations
* Note which features exhibited high multicollinearity.
* Explain how you addressed it (dropped features, combined, or used regularization).
* Highlight the impact on the regression results.
