### **üè° Housing Price Prediction - A Learning Case Study - I**

Welcome to my Housing Price Prediction case study! In this project, I predicted house prices based on various features using Multiple Linear Regression (MLR). The dataset contains information like the area of the house, the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and other attributes like air conditioning, main road access, and more.

This repository covers everything from data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, and evaluation to insights and conclusions.

### üìä Project Overview

This case study involves predicting house prices based on multiple features. It serves as an example of how I approach the process of data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, and evaluation. This hands-on project allows me to practice applying theoretical knowledge into practical use cases.

The key steps I followed are:

* Data Preprocessing: Handling outliers, encoding categorical variables, scaling data
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing data, identifying relationships between features.
* Model Building: Implementing Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)
* Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model with metrics like MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R¬≤ Score

### üèóÔ∏è Model Building

Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)

I trained the model using the LinearRegression class from Scikit-learn. The model was fitted on the data to learn the relationship between the features and the target (price).
