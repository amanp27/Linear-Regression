### **üè° Housing Price Prediction Case Study**

Welcome to my Housing Price Prediction case study! In this project, I predicted house prices based on various features using Multiple Linear Regression (MLR). The dataset contains information like the area of the house, the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and other attributes like air conditioning, main road access, and more.

This repository covers everything from data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, and evaluation to insights and conclusions.
