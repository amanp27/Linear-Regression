🎯 Why Learn Linear Regression?

Linear Regression is not just an algorithm; it's a stepping stone to mastering machine learning. It helps you:

* Understand the relationship between features and targets.
* Interpret coefficients to draw meaningful insights.
* Build baseline models for regression tasks.

🌟 Visualize the Flow

* The model fits a line that minimizes the error between predicted and actual values.
* Visualization tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn are used to illustrate the relationship.

📝 Next Steps

* ✅ Start with Simple Linear Regression.
* 🚀 Progress to Multiple Linear Regression.
* 📈 Extend to Polynomial Regression in the future!

🛠 Tools and Libraries Used

* Python
* NumPy, Pandas for data handling.
* Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization.
* Scikit-learn for model building.
